Keras: 
What is it: Keras is a beginner-friendly toolkit for working with neural networks. It is the front-end interface for TensorFlow. 

Background: Google engineer Francois Choillet released Keras in 2015 to act as an API for a number of deep learning libraries. As of 2020, Keras is exclusive to TensorFlow.

Features: Keras handles the high level tasks of building neural networks in TensorFlow, and as such contains fundamental modules like activation functions, layers, optimizers, and more. 

Keras supports vanilla neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks as well as utility layers including batch normalization, dropout, and pooling. 
It is designed to simplify coding deep neural networks. 
Best for: Developing deep learning networks.

Downsides: It’s only available for TensorFlow users. If you use TensorFlow, you’re using Keras.
