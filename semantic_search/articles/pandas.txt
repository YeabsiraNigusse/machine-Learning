Pandas: If you need to manipulate data
What is it: Pandas is a package for simultaneously working with different types of labeled data. Youâ€™d use it, for example, if you need to analyze a CSV file containing numerical, alphabetical, and string data. 

Background: Wes McKinney released Pandas in 2008. It builds on NumPy (and, in fact, you must have NumPy installed to use Pandas) and extends that package to work with heterogeneous data. 

Features: The core feature of Pandas is its variety of data structures, which let users perform an assortment of analysis operations. 

Pandas has a variety of modules for data manipulation, including reshape, join, merge, and pivot. 
Pandas has data visualization capabilities.
Users can perform mathematical operations including calculus and statistics without calling on outside libraries. 
It has modules that help you work around missing data.

Best for: Data analysis. 

Downsides: Switching between vanilla Python and Pandas can be confusing, as the latter has a slightly more complex syntax. Pandas also has a steep learning curve. These factors, combined with poor documentation, can make it difficult to pick up.
