        "\n",
        "In the Model Evaluation and Selection folder, we saw how to evaluate a learning algorithm's performance by measuring its training and cross validation error. Given these values, we are able to quantify how well a model is doing and this helps you make a decision on which one to use for a given application. In this notebook, we will build upon this process and explore some tips to improve the performance of our models. As it turns out, the training and cross validation errors can tell you what to try next to improve our models. Specifically, it will show if you have a high bias (underfitting) or high variance (overfitting) problem. This lecture slide shown below gives an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "To fix a high bias problem, you can:\n",
        "* try adding polynomial features\n",
        "* try getting additional features\n",
        "* try decreasing the regularization parameter\n",
        "\n",
        "To fix a high variance problem, you can:\n",
        "* try increasing the regularization parameter\n",
        "* try smaller sets of features\n",
